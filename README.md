# Vidly-Magic
A video rental app built in ASP.net MVC

* You can add, edit and delete movies with thumbnails and trailers.
* All movies are displayed in the gallery on the home page.
* You can add, edit and delete customers. 
* You can rent movies to a customer, check a movie in, and set a customer as delinquent.
* You can manage current and past rentals
* You can manage users and set roles directly from the UI.
* Views are rendered differently according to user's roles
* All CRUD operations are implemented with Ajax and WebApi.
* All designs are self-made.
* I have perfected the user experience down to the details using CSS and javascript, and added lots of UI sugar, for example, when adding or editing a movie, the image changes as the user selects it on the client-side using javascript, you will notice more UI sugar as you are surfing the site.
